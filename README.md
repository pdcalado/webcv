# Web CV [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/pdcalado/webcv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pdcalado/webcv) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2d321ff43b6c4047a1229f1d0dea794a)](https://www.codacy.com/app/pdcalado/webcv?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=pdcalado/webcv&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is the source code of my cv webpage.

## Overview

All personal data must be imported from an unversioned file.

This is still a work in progress, not ready for use.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

File structure is inspired by [Fractal](https://hackernoon.com/fractal-a-react-app-structure-for-infinite-scale-4dab943092af).

## Why?

* Others might be interested in using it and they may do so at will.
* Because my JS and CSS skills can be improved and this is a nice side project for it.

## Adapting to your use case

* Add a file called data.js in `src/` and fill it with the same keys as [.pseudo-data.js](.pseudo-data.js)
* Add a favicon.ico to `public/`
* Build with `npm build` and serve the build folder
