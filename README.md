# Web CV [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/pdcalado/webcv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pdcalado/webcv)

This is the source code of my cv webpage.

All personal data must be imported from an unversioned file.

This is still a work in progress, not ready for use.

File structure is inspired by [Fractal](https://hackernoon.com/fractal-a-react-app-structure-for-infinite-scale-4dab943092af).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
